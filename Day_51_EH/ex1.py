#Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions.
# Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand,
# exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program.

# Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code.
# It leads to the termination of the program.



# SyntaxError: This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code,
# such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.
# print('hello python'
#SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
