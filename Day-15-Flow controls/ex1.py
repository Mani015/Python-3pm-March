# Conditional statements
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false.
# You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition.
# Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.

# There are three types of conditional statements.

# if statement
# if-else
# if-elif-else
# nested if-else

# THe condition true if block code will be excute
# the condition is false else block code will be excute

# if
# Syntax: if condtion:
#              block of code

a = True

if a:
    print('this condition is true')


# this condition is true
