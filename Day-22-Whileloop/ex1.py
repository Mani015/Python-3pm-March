# while loop:In Python,
# The while loop statement repeatedly executes a code block while a particular condition is true

# In simple words, The while loop enables the Python program to repeat a set of operations while a particular condition
# is true. When the condition becomes false, execution comes out of the loop immediately,
# and the first statement after the while loop is executed.


i=0

# while condition:
#     print(lines of statements)


# while i<2:
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
#
# print('loop excuted')

# 0
# 1
# loop excuted
