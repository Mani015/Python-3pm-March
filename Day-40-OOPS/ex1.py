#  OOP concepts include object, classes, constructor and encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance,Abstraction.


# What is Object Oriented Programming in Python
# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".
# The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).
#
# An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects.
# Python programming language supports different programming approaches like functional programming, modular programming.
# One of the popular approaches is object-oriented programming (OOP) to solve a programming problem is by creating objects


# This introduced by Alen kay intro oopp in 1966 for simulation Programming

# First oopp used in simula programming.

# Programming Paradigm: Approach/Statergey/Procedure/

# Oops is Real Word entity


# What is a Class and Objects in Python?
# Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that binds the data members and methods into a single unit.
# Class is a blueprint or code template for object creation. Using a class, you can create as many objects as you want.
# Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of attributes (variables) and methods. We use the object of a class to perform actions.


# def FunctionName():
#     print('I am Class')
# Calling Function:
# FunctionName()



# Syntax:
# class Class_Name:
#     print('I am Class')
# Class_Name()


x = []
print(type(x))
# <class 'list'>
x1 = []
x2 = []
x3 = []
