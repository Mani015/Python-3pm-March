# raw string
# In programming, a raw string is a string literal that treats backslashes ()
# as literal characters instead of escape characters.
# This means that any backslashes in a raw string are interpreted as part of the string itself,
# rather than having special meaning.
x = 'my name \\\\python'
print(x)
# my name \\python

print(r'my name is \\\\ python')
# my name is \\\\ python
